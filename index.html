        <h1>Content1</h1>
        <p>The vast territory of British Columbia lies almost entirely within the great mountain system, or
            cordillera,
            that stretches along the western edge of the Americas from north of the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, at
            the
            southernmost extremity of South America. These mountains divide the province in ranges aligned in a
            northwest-southeast direction, creating a series of valleys and a broad central interior plateau where
            human
            settlement has concentrated. The two major ranges are the Coast Mountains, which lie in the western part
            of
            the province, and the Canadian portion of the Rocky Mountains in the eastern part. The province reaches
            its
            highest elevation in the far northwest at Mount Fairweather (15,300 feet [4,663 metres]), located in the
            St.
            Elias Mountains (a range of the Coast Mountains) on the Alaskan border. Hundreds of coast-hugging
            islands—the largest of which are Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte
            Islands)—offer a protected waterway along the coastline, which is indented by narrow fjords that twist
            inland about the bases of towering mountains. The broad Fraser delta, behind Vancouver to the south, is
            the
            largest of the limited coastal lowlands. In the interior many of the wide plateaus are cut by deep
            canyons
            and entirely surrounded by mountain ranges, including the Cassiar, Omineca, Skeena, and Hazelton
            mountains
            in the north and the Columbia Mountains in the southeast.</p>
